# Console app - Expense tracker
#### Description
This project lets you organize expanses, where expanses have different categories like: fun, food, travel, rent etc.
You can add, delete, view expanses, filter by categories and dates. 
This app doesn't use database but rather uses local .json file to store/load data.
